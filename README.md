#  About Me:

I am a full-life researcher. I have worked on economics, healthcare, space engineering, theoretical statistics, actuarial science, soccer analytics, and more. I enjoyed exploring each of these domain, but fair to say I still know very little about them. 

Lately, Iâ€™ve been drawn to the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and causality, as well as neuroimage analysis. My ultimate goal in life is to be friends with Gorilla.
